# kareem-s-macropad
My own macro pad to use to boost my coding productivity also my first actual project involving pcb's and 3d printed parts
im not really good at naming stuf so here my name :) even tho the macropads ugly i still made it, it has 12 switches(including that of the rotary encoder) along with a 128x32 OLED display and a ec11 rotary encoder

(ik it looks ugly but its my first time T-T)

**FIRMWARE**
for the firmware i just made it so that all the keys write letters,ill actually make them do something when/if i get the hardware(no the rotary encoder doesnt do anything for now other than its button writing a letter)

**this is all just three days of work with literally 0 experience before so like if it wasnt obvious now u know**

**BOM**
1x xiao rp2040
11x cherry mx switches 
1x ec11 rotary encoder
1x 0.91 128x32 OLED
